							<span class="first-child-span"><strong> Health is a fragile treasure that we must cherish. Often, we only realize its value
								when we lose it. My story is a testament to the strength of the human spirit in the
								face of adversity and the importance of love and support from loved ones.<br>
								At the age of 14, I was diagnosed with a disease that changed my life and led me
								through a succession of hospital admissions, treatments and suffering. The year
								2020 was the darkest, and I spent more time in hospital than at home. My joy,
								inner peace and appetite disappeared, replaced by overwhelming fatigue and a
								feeling of injustice.
							
								The illness didn't just attack my body, it also consumed my soul. The worried
								looks on my parents' faces, especially my mother's, pierced my heart. I wondered
								why me? What had I done to deserve this punishment? Sadness and despair
								threatened to overwhelm me.
								Despite the pain and fatigue, I was determined to maintain a facade of normality. I
								continued to go to school, hiding my suffering behind a smile. My absences were
								noticed, but no one really understood the extent of my ordeal.
								My parents have been invaluable pillars of strength. My father went into debt to
								pay for my care, my mother sacrificed her job to stay by my side. My brothers did
								everything they could to put a smile back on my face and give me hope. Their love
								and support have been my lifeline in this storm.
								This story has no definitive ending. It is up to me to write the sequel, to fight for
								life and savor every precious moment. My illness has taught me the importance of
								William 3
								resilience, gratitude, and love. It has shown me that even in the deepest darkness,
								hope can spring forth.</strong></span>
